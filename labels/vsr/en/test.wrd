not a single one
so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make of it
how much can we change
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
you're in there
that's really important
but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and we couldn't just turn it off
we can see how to do that
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
how else can we create new ideas
that was powerful
raise your hands
it's actually not that hard
and then we were alarmed to discover something
as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
no plankton means no fish
not when you get lung cancer
it's always what it was and what it can be
well guess what
now i know why i'm here
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
go i said again sweat forming on my brow
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
this is a real mystery
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
but in fact they found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
you would be issuing orders from above
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
and that's actually what happened
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
i don't have an overview
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
because it's given by other people
trust is the response
let me give you a simple commercial example
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
how do you know for sure
i am certainly not the hardest working
i was the first non family investor in amazon
it has never happened
i was a mediocre student
this is nonsense
and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
most of my friends were taking japanese
and i thought this would be great fun
and now i love languages
and this routine went on for some time
i was always very small
so i thought why not punish myself
i know nothing
so water was something that scared me to begin with
but i would go in on occasion
i tried everything
think about that
of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level these days
terrorists are doing this
we've all done this
when it's 10 degrees below zero
there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
could we merge
she suffered so much
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
that didn't happen to me
make it go away
make it go away
make it go away
we can't identify with that part
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
we know why kids don't learn
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
you made it work for me
we can do this
one year i came up with a bright idea
but i need your help
how cool is that
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
how do i get through the hardest part
sort of leadership by humiliation
i said where is he now
thanks for asking
but you know what
but you know what
i don't have an answer
what's this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
who or what inspires you and why
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
let us have a hong kong nearby
but there's actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules are put together
why did my child develop autism
you just have to find another term and look that up
i do like magic
you don't do much editing
they're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
and 67 percent of people come back
we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
they're just waiting for their day in court
it impacts everything
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
and i couldn't get this information out
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
it impacts sentencing
it impacts crime and violence
and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
i ran the camden police department because of that
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
we have no suspects
we have no suspects
only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
that was the only way to get anything done
efficiency is for robots
human relationships are not efficient
that's available right now
art is not efficient
well not so fast
seventy five percent of them are women and children
she got a support network
that was her fight
she learned about her rights
she was doing okay
okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
we can drive around
and we all know this
we can get volunteers
we don't have enough money
how could i come from a nation
what kind of rituals are these
the rituals were familiar
that didn't go over really well
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
is it about earning as much as you possibly can
i would never want to do that
how should we live
we need to reinvent labor organizing
how should we work
we need portable health benefits
i don't paint
this is going to become really freaking obvious
so thank you very much
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
we shouldn't be nationalistic
i made a mistake
and here's what you need to know
why did you bring this up
what do you do
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
she said yeah
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
i guess i'm doing it right now
i study shame
your wife left you
i'm a fifth generation texan
so i went to church as often as i could
so what happens next
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
could we leverage the cloud
so why don't we leverage that
the answer to that question is a very definitive
they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
it's all about what can you do for me
agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
what are your intentions toward others
it wasn't who i was
here's where i stand
in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
thank you very much
roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials
what do we need to do
and remember we had experience with this
that is not simply critical to our economy
what can we do in all of this
i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i'm not a social problem guy
but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
especially when it comes to climate change
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
well we rejected all of that
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that's used by real people has them
that's what texting is
it's a marker of empathy
texting has developed one from this slash
only one percent of the people are actually farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
take a look at these
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
i will be back
does the water stay there forever
it has to stop
it's a debate about words about metaphors
i do understand it
let's have that
doesn't happen very much
what about polio
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
no one's ever said that before
we don't trust the man
i don't know
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
they are doing it together
or any national leader
he wouldn't like the answer
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
in fact it's more like five percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
you've broken your back
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
you'll never walk again
what can i do about it
that's a terrible waste of time
do that only if you're paid by the hour
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
you are a healer in a stone age village
and so it's perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
but eventually they did come around
one way around this is to draw pictures
and this idea is actually nothing new
i didn't always succeed
i was living in my own apartment
i hadn't bathed in three days
i was winning awards
and i cried
i was no longer homeless
why are you really here
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
it's just not possible
but it's more complicated
so no more missing guys
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
when you grow up poor you want to be rich
he's at a technology conference in florida
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
most independent media was shut down
we have to fix the internet
we have to fix our education
so i learned never to move
it would skip a beat
it would start
it would stop
and i felt all this
we have to get quiet
you haven't earned it
how can we do it
the nazis invaded the netherlands
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
so was mother teresa
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
why do we need to study this anymore
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
we're looking for something more
come on man
and i was really scared
but i found one
the irony is so obvious right
is it that i write very well
it was like a star trek episode you know
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
how do you get informed
even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
there's no more of it
we paid two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
we're not going to be able to do that
so it's the demand that brings them to the table
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
we will not be there
look at the end to see the animal
so what to do next
how much they do
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we ought to celebrate
has it gotten better
something was wrong
we're blessed with people who listen to us
irreconcilable differences right
and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
every kid lives near nature
i just disagree with this
i want to go
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like oh the amazon
there's people everywhere
there's pollination going on
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
and this is crazy
they grow crops
and he wanted one so badly
you smell money
we wouldn't tolerate that
thank you very much
storytelling is so important
stories are amazing
what would happen
now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
but what does
it's natural connective tissue
we don't need moore's law to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
we have problems that we desperately need to solve
we just need to keep going
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
and here's where those guns come in
i had just graduated from harvard college
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
the question why does she stay
give me input
and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
you make it flow under and over
what do they have
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
do they have aids
do they have a common cold
look at this pretty structure
has a coherent movement
i didn't know where i was
i don't care
well not yet
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
they have bad ideas
that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
it's about the data
we lost valuable data
what if i had told her my story years ago
after all i was a bit unconventional
i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
it's changed the way we talk
had no idea
the board of ed
they don't trust the law
it's not true
why don't they trust the law
i'm in tucson
it's just incredible
everything in the universe wears out
and that blew my mind
how is that possible
we've been working together since well since we were kids really
which brought us to this
of those seven have nuclear weapons
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a surgery lexicon
that is great
thank you very much
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
i have an idea for saving the world
i said we work together
tell me about that
and work like a dog
and that's all
that's your grandfather
they were all white
so they felt safe to come there
we didn't understand the program
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
but you know what the actual facts are
but now it's turned around
then they had to bring them in
it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
i feel that god knows me
so we decided to go to the mosque
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
well we bought one of these
we're on the grid
we're going to eat these cows
it's not a luxury
it's not optional
they're not being shipped up here
it is irresponsible
it is wrong
this is not a put down of anyone
are we brave enough to welcome it
but it's different
did you hear he has gone mad
they're not my children
and i did not know what to say
and when we're unprepared we overreact
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
it's not exactly rocket science
young people as well
and that's what we did
we hear the chaos of war
thank you very much
the silent majority does not need to be silent
we hear terrorism
let's help them have a voice
i don't know
i made more money
this is great
i love red wine
lots of money
we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
supporting local economies
i'm going to be so healthy
so let's start there
i want to know how they impact me
it's a top predator
i want to know how i impact them
where would it go
who would i meet
we let other people worry about it
could i go there
you can walk around them
i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
the whole internet
is it heavy
you can experience their sense of place
one woman shoots her face
cluster bombs left behind
one woman straps herself
harvest contaminated tobacco
i will craft my own drum
one woman gives birth to borders
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
one woman gives birth to a baby
we mourn women complicated
rhythm is half silence
my spine curves spiral
one woman loses her head
sickness health tender violence
one woman never did
i will not be played
faced with absence
where do refugee hearts go
one woman feeds on trash
i live cycles of light and darkness
how far away was the finish line
i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry
they will sit in them forever
so what is an idea drawing
here i'm one person talking to you
you're all collective
and if it's completely okay what's the joke
this is completely bizarre
don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i've tried engaging people
and guess what silicon valley
and he surprised me by saying you know what
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
they're not heavily subsidized
it cracked open my world
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
she would hide in the closet
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
thank you very much
that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
i'm 27 years old
who's at the event
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
but here's the thing
i don't know
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
she never wanted to tell me
constance baker motley
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
that is the right answer
my parents came from germany
so what was i going to do
does any of this matter
it's about people
we just need to act on it
the net outcome
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
that even small scale farmers can leverage
thank you very much
i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
it was the coldest i've ever been
why are we skipping over this
this is a really important chapter to me
i wanted to stay in this relationship
i went to the dean
things were going well
and my whole world did open up
and who does that benefit
we now have a platform
you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
it's a win all around
but we're not there yet
data drives better decisions
why not just let businesses compete
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
i am full of contradictions
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
we have the right to respect
i want no part of any of that
they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
thanks very much
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
i can hardly wait
growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
that's not to say it's impossible
he was also the first person to call me a feminist
my brothers are not as interested as i am
so they added oxygen to methane gas
the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
well you get several things
he got part time i
i forgive you and i do not hate you
one was to be a soldier
they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
the other was to be a baseball player
i'm not a military brat
i want to be the center of attention
the same tool that united us to topple dictators
i was terrified
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
what kind of trauma am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
for depression it was four and a half times
but things have changed
you remember carlos
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
and that's exactly what that is
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
out to dinner with family
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
my father worked at this factory he said
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
my grandfather worked at this factory
why not ask all of the states to do that instead
and does it matter
it's very hard to get of course
i was talking about interaction design
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
what we want what we aspire to is the code
we're going to stay with them forever
i mean that interface is beautiful
designers aspire to be really great designers
first they founded political parties
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
now hamilton was everything madison was not
who cleans up after us
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
i wanted to understand who takes the job
the economy needs them
take a moment to say thank you
they have different interests
but it's not about fire and brimstone either
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
they have divergent values
and she's looking as young as ever
there is an animated series in the works
but there's so much potential
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
brought in younger men
and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
and this is true
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic process
blocks have names
well that's what predictions are
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
i know i have
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
i'm totally serious
it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
and so how does your brain give you that detail
so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
would you like to create a second one together
and then i thought there's got to be a better way
they want to be part of it
and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
because we can
there's a flip side as well
it's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of american
it's a performance venue
but it's not enough
i've built a career
and they're not just focused on money
we are magic
well that's exciting
one billion people
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
but it's not just china
we suspended our values
where are the philosophers
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
i tried everything
maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
i know i didn't
so i was jealous
i think i'm a normal person
what are the researchers learning
are they attractive
so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
when you're six maybe you can do that
are they a potential mate
how old are you
i teach at stanford
i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
we're losing a ritual
this is when i was in texas
they had her scanned inside out
i would listen to the heart
but it wasn't just individuals
that's what's so complicated about war
we have to answer that
some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
it's not what i had expected
it was incredibly hot
the boys are up there for a year
how does that work
what is it that he misses
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
please look at me
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
he should not have been surprised
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
we can change our minds
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
you can try it
that's pretty cool
we have the plan
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them got caught up in the water
and germany and france
surely we know enough
4 times the mass of the sun
i have resources
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
i am torn by your love for me
i remember what you said to me
and i said i don't know
i am thinking of your love for me
remember what i said my love
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
and this change is getting more rapid
but the question is who will have it
there will be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
this is possible
make it about the other party
we've done the research
mortality is not going down it's going up
and in fact it probably won't
so we have these feast and famine cycles
so what do you think happens to these gals
and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
she had to impersonate a man
and not enough is being done about this
they're often not recognized sent home
so thank you for your attention
well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
it told us about hormone replacement therapy
women are worth it
i'm not sure what it was
how are you
so why is it
did you learn to wash your hands in school
why aren't people washing their hands
did you learn to wash your hands at home
there's no structure
so how do we do that
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
you say you're working more than 60 hours
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
well are you sure
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
it should be inspiring
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
he made me feel smart
you saw him act
i could make that decision
plus we have stem cells
and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
the engine fails
the plane takes off
you board the plane
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
it's been thought about for a while
we have to throw it away
so this is obvious right
so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
texting has a 100 percent open rate
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
it's my dad
that last one's an actual text message that we received
i will not forget the day we got that text message
we could only think of one way
we can open up city hall
i wasn't very good at reading things
and that might have been the case
and that leads to a very powerful tool
i have to take a year off
that's what happened with my dad
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad has alzheimer's disease
i'm trying to become a better person
even when it's so hard
how could i let them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
women's day was coming up
and you know what
it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
they were right
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
he wanted to keep score
when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
you learn more about how computers work
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points to things
you just move away
you're more cautious
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
thank you very much
they can't get what they need when they need it
gov just six people
that's the status quo today
yes it's hard
and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
that's what we do
you were born to
we were wrong
now that's a very very good point
and this leads to oddities
but this is the source of innovation
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtime
there's nothing underground about it
that's awful right
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
again it will not happen overnight
we're part of the same family
i have three sons so i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
we're not just part of the same species
so that's what i'm doing
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not a park
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
take my child
she worked in a bank
i believe a story there has to be told
i have to report it
they don't get their money out
who cares about bosnia
and they were basically having fun
i started looking at them really carefully
we need to be part of a community to survive
is it about systems
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
we all know deep inside what the answer is
is it about equality
we've known since we were babies
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
i was going through a hard time as well
i was like what
what about you
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
and it is important
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
i take it to therapy
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
the answer was no
this is how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
do you remember what it was
there were no back doors
i even read many self help books
the first lesson is about humility
try it and let me know how it works for you
i would love to hear from you
i actually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
go pick up the keys
i know it works
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
what makes the heart unique
it turns out the evidence says otherwise
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
i tried everything
they have social meaning
they were unexpected pleasures
or where does he live
sometimes it goes further
strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 emails
my own website
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
and looking at that pattern
he saw it written down somewhere
and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
that's sort of the state of the art
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pull and poke and prod things
we would just get noise back
so that's it for now
at the same time
this is the only part that's battery backed up
the science is there
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
they just do it
i was petrified
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
again in a car
not a lot of hands
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
we harbor bias
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
well that's what i thought
we know that we are right and they are wrong
harness your internal strength
that's more expensive
and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
so bear with me
thank you very much
they won the game
the boys reminded me of home
i didn't want to
life is good
they had hit the jackpot
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
it wasn't like them to miss practice
i said in arabic
1 percent who get to do that
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
and dance has progressed
and this is happening every day
i don't understand
we're not playing with each other
there's a million different ways to eat pizza
if we're still hungry we might have some more
there are no external cameras
my other great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
government officials are extremely mad
but those surveillance features come at a cost
it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
you might get impeached for that
it's a fucking orgy
they feel at home
how is it made
why was it made
just think about it
but it's a global phenomenon
it's the war on terror
how do you change your behavior
he could come over and help me
i know you understand that
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all night long
that's what moves you
what is the abstraction
i'm in the crucible right now
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always trying to make it faster
and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
it's kind of the anti reality tv
how are we going to do that
please sign here right now
it's more annoying
why does a jellyfish emit light
or a firefly
and that's powerful
no not how much
it goes wrong
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
it showed no blockages
and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
but linda was lucky
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
we know that every cell has a sex
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
i started off in uganda
make me laugh
well why is that
what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
now i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
well what difference does this make
otherwise millions more will die
quite the opposite
i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what would that change about how we live
and how is that possible
buildings can be like people
their faces broadcast their experience
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
which brings me to my second point
and it doesn't
so naturally i asked what is african
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
actually studied hormones
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
we can't see it most of the time
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
how does it happen
we said yes
we were so excited
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
thank you for your time
i'll let you continue
did you find the gold
you just had to do things sometimes
so we created a new school
and boy they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
how do you get to build those relationships
like why did i really have to mow the lawn
and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
you can't run around in the dark
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
dan replies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
and then something falls off the wall
no more charge before use
now do something different
that would not work
well i was surprised
i did not know this
and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
it was appalling
what can i learn with you
this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
but that system has tons of problems
or do you think the government should redistribute
they don't represent what our views are
and nothing happened at all
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
but that is not the case at all
so i'm in the media
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help
you know about numbers
you can navigate space
that's not an improbable sample
and so they took them to some safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what did happen to my brain
why do i believe this
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
we met men where they were at and we built a program
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
we were making what was invisible visible
and that's what we did
we were obviously making a difference
and you know what else we did
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
take a look at one of our spots
but we were still missing a critical element
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
there were others like myself who were full time
i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
they need support
we had law enforcement partners
the key here really is knowledge
three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
don't create solutions to impress customers
what about manipulation
so that's mobile manipulation
i love building robots
one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
some did not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government level
even that wasn't enough
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
and when we do the results will often surprise
he's five years old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one way
we don't use audio we don't use video
originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
we take less notice of trivial matters
how frustrated are you right now
how sad are you right now
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
now don't get me wrong
of course they would
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
what is worth dying for
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
and not just that
they met together
why is it important now
so what did they do
i feel guilty sometimes
your job needs to be challenging
boy it matters a lot
so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
he's a great guy
what do you mean
you want to work for him
that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
we have no control over these forces
again it had no choice
it had no choice
i realize of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
that's nothing special
not right now
we're seeing the baby brain
i looked at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level
there's no need to play the market
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
why is it not working
you're doing incredibly important work
i think this is a problem
beth israel's in boston
i don't look different
now i'm ready for my interview
i needed an education
i'm not short
i was right there with you
we must adopt that way of giving back
again let's just play
did i get my upgrade
that doesn't probably happen every day
it really is quite phenomenal
that option is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
this will pay dividends
last week alone i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
but i'm a big fan of you as a person
and that's pretty amazing
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
5 percent today
how is that possible
that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
this isn't information
and that led me to this project
we have to turn that around
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
they want a treatment
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
they change from person to person
what is that
she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
we have to decide what it means
what a contradiction
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
we can do it again
what makes technology useful and usable
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
which means take my camera
so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
do the same thing at work
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so i went to my doctor
but i'm not happy
but that's kind of a big problem
that's my question
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
i have passion in my heart
it's just a wall
i can stand up and do something
let me tell you about a couple of them
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
which incidentally is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
this is your chance
can we really scale this up
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
how do they operate
but i love it for a totally different reason
they make sense of the past
i tagged along with my neighbors
i'll meet you there
and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
who wrote that
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
and they don't need to ask for permission
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
that wasn't being asked
what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
she got unlucky
and is this really the solution
and that's bad
they don't have meaning
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
i'm pushing and pulling with this object
pretty much everybody else who does polls
but i don't
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
the group gels
my life really sucks
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
what about martin luther king
all of you are members of tribes
and you don't leave them where they are
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
and he grew up essentially in stage one
life is great
you know they do polls right
i don't know anybody
but we're not done yet
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
there was no road map
you don't want this
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
we might say then well let's not worry about this
they're looking and looking and finding love
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
but it's also an important date for another reason
have inspired a generation of innovators
